## Getting Started with CS2 ðŸš€

Start easily with our default configs.

Place `*.cfg` files in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`
(You can probably navigate this through steam)

Enter:

`exec prac` â€“ Starts Practice Mode

`exec comp` â€“ Starts Competitive Mode

`exec overtime` - Starts Overtime Competitve Mode (NOT TESTED)

`exec live` â€“ Starts a Competitive Match (run `exec comp` or `exec overtime` first)

Happy gaming! ðŸ”¥
